I am Sergei, a full-stack software engineer in the JavaScript domain with 10+ years of development experience. I have a Masterâ€™s in Math. I am a passionate learner, in deep love with what I do for a living.

I was born in Russia and right now I live in Berlin, Germany. I love travelling and architecture. And other kinds of stuff.

That's in short, but <a href="">here is more</a> :)
