So, I would say I am ** 70% frontend ** software engineer. That is why the following stack I use every day during my work process:
[/BLOCK]
[BLOCK widget=Skills type=main]1[/BLOCK]
[BLOCK contentAlign=center]
When it comes to the backend part, my best choice is
[/BLOCK]
[BLOCK widget=Skills type=backend]1[/BLOCK]
[BLOCK widget=Block contentAlign=center]
For a full-stack engineer it is crucial to understand how the system is gonna to be deployed, so occasionally I use these:
[/BLOCK]
[BLOCK widget=Skills type=rest]1[/BLOCK]
[BLOCK]
There are also few technologies that I, generally speaking, don't work with anymore, even though from time to time I may look into it.
[/BLOCK]
[BLOCK widget=Skills type=dated]1[/BLOCK]
[BLOCK widget=Block contentAlign=center]
As for the code management, I personally prefer GIT, but HG also works :)

I hope that you find my tech radar diverse and aligned with yours. If there is a match, drop me a message!
