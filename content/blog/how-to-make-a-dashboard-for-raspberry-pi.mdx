import { Container } from 'components/Container';

Once upon a time...

I was not able to build ARM Docker images on my Mac, since I ran into this issue:
https://github.com/nodejs/docker-node/issues/873

But, I have a virtual machine...

```bash
sudo printf "\n{\n   \"experimental\": true\n}\n" >> /etc/docker/daemon.json;
```

```bash
sudo stress --cpu 8 --timeout 20
```
