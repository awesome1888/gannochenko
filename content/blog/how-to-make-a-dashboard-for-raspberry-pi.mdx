import { Container } from 'components/Container';

Once upon a time...

I was not able to build ARM images on both Mac and Linux virtual machine I have, since I ran into some issues on both.
`docker build --platform linux/arm64` did not help as well.
So I have decided to not to spend another decade trying to solve the issue, and just build the image on raspberry pi itself.

```bash
sudo stress --cpu 8 --timeout 20
```
