## The company says it is your family

But it really is not. Family is a collective that made you. They grew you up with love (hopefully) and invested in you a lot. Family considers you being it's legacy, something it will leave after. And no matter how much you screw up, your parents will (hopefully) still love you and welcome you in the house.
A company is not like that. They let those really bright slogans out: "Join us, be family", but in fact you are just a non-invaluable asset to them. A tool. A instrument that is supposed to do work and deliver, so the company can function. When you don't, they will first try to fix you, like you fix your coffee machine when it misbehaves.
If you are (from their point of view) beyond repairs, they wish you all the best and immediately find a replacement.
You can't really blame them for the way it works, they need to do business or die, but don't overestimate this "family on conditions" attitude. 

## You don't want to give up you projects

Then thing is that noting is really yours there. The company owns everything you make between 9:00 and 18:00, just as your contract depicts. Sometimes they can even try to [claim rights on your pet projects](https://thebell.io/en/corporate-raiding-scandal-engulfs-russian-internet-pioneer/), if it reveals you made contributions within that time frame.
So, don't be flattered, as soon as you are out, "your" project will become someone else's.

## You have golden handcuffs

Well, if the company bought your apartment, then you are definitely in trouble. But if you have something like LTIP, then ask yourself: is this money worth sacrificing your potential career? When you grow enough to earn the same amount as your LTIP *potentiall* brings, wouldn't it be a better opportunity?

## You boss or teammates say you are doing great

It is only natural to value appreciation given to us by others. But, the only sacrifice for the company is material form of appreciation, where you get what you really deserve in terms of money.
If you have low salary, but everyone around says you are a great guy, then something is really off.
Don't work for likes, work for money.

## You are deeply stuck in the middle of your comfort zone
