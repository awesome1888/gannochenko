import { Container } from 'components/Container';

## Frontend

React. Gatsby. Vercel.

First I hosted on Github pages, it even seemed faster than anything else (according to the Lighthouse), but when it came to Russia, the .dev domain showed stupid 404 no matter what I have tried to manage. I guess, it has something to do with RKN and black russian helicopters. So I moved to Vercel shortly after.

## Backend

At first, wanted to run a container. But for running a container I will have to pay even when it is idle. That is why, serverless is a perfect choice here.

Especially when it comes to AWS, where, by chance, one can have a free tier.

I would use Terraform to deploy a thing even that small, because I really hate AWS UI (no offense).

## Alternatives

NextJS
