import { Container } from 'components/Container';

Why Auth0? The service is mature and has a truly generous free plan (...describe).
I like when everything is free or almost free (yes, I am a SAAS gypsy).

## Basic stuff, with React npm packages

### Auth

#### Provider
 
 
#### Auth0-to-MobX bridge

I am not a huge fan of "put-all-you-have-into-a-hook-and-use-it". Even though hooks is a great feature by itself, I usually prefer using only basic hooks, and keep my logic somewhere else.
In this case, in MobX state. If you tend to stick to the pure react-way, just skip this part.

So I made a MobX abstraction over Auth0 hooks, called `auth-state`. It helps also to hide all the complexity of Auth0 response behind a rather simple abstraction.

### AuthWidget

## RBAC and "protected" routes

I could have had `RBAC` on my backend side, but it is quite expensive (or time consuming) to make. Instead, I decided to check out what Auth0 has to offer.

Up to this point everything was smooth... except that I needed to know roles client-side to enable the "protected routes" feature in my SPA.
Roles are [not included into the user object](https://auth0.com/docs/api/authentication#get-user-info), and there is no way to get it unless I call [the management api](https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2#!/Users/get_user_roles).
To call this API I apparently need a special kind of management token, which is not possible to get from the client side (without knowing the app secret).

It is funny to notice once in a while, how a tiny misconception is able ruin great overall experience and make you bump against a wall for a couple of hours =( For an SPA there is an obvious urge to have roles accessible via a "user"-type token! That is where I felt like stuck and depressed.

Then I came across the [extensions](https://auth0.com/docs/extensions/authorization-extension/v2)

https://manage.auth0.com/dashboard/eu/gannochenko/extensions

~~~js
try {
    // load metadata
    const accessToken = await this.getAccessTokenMethod!({
        audience: `https://${this.domain}/api/v2/`,
        scope: 'read:current_user',
    });

    const userDetailsByIdUrl = `https://${this.domain}/api/v2/users/${user.sub}`;

    const metadataResponse = await fetch(userDetailsByIdUrl, {
        headers: {
            Authorization: `Bearer ${accessToken}`,
        },
    });

    const data = await metadataResponse.json();
    const roles = data.app_metadata.authorization.roles as string[];

    // ...
} catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
}
~~~

This solution solves the case, yet it is far from ideal: I have to re-get user info, and that is +1 query that delays the first meaningful data paint.

I want my app work faster, that is why I have decided to put roles into a token itself. To do that, I create another rule AFTER the Auth Extension rule:

~~~js
function (user, context, callback) {
    var namespace = 'http://auth0-test/claims/'; // You can set your own namespace, but do not use an Auth0 domain
    
    // Add the namespaced tokens. Remove any which is not necessary for your scenario
    context.idToken[namespace + "permissions"] = user.permissions;
    context.idToken[namespace + "groups"] = user.groups;
    context.idToken[namespace + "roles"] = user.roles;
    
    callback(null, user, context);
}
~~~

The value of the `namespace` should be of format `http://your-domain/claims/`, otherwise the thing does not work. This is weird, not to say the least, but it eventually the roles get available via the `http://auth0-test/claims/roles` key in the user object.

This solution is not ideal too: in case if I update a user, they will have to re-login to make effect. In my case it is not crucial since I seldom update my users.

If you update users often, then on each update you need to invalidate all the tokens. Plus, you will have to make that extra query all the time.

## Protected route component

## Backend part

The backend part is no less complex than the front.

First of all, it worth to mention, that it is totally doable to implement all the endpoints on the side of your own application. There is [a great tutorial](https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/webapp/nodejs) to the rescue.
I did not want this complexity in the first place, that is why I consume Auth0 infrastructure directly.

Secondly, if you don't rely on what is inside of a token, you have to make an additional query to get the user's data. So this would be +1 remote call per each endpoint hit.
You can, however, cache the obtained user data to Redis. Unfortunately, then you would be forced to add a cache invalidation hook on the Auth0 side. Since theirs and yours infras do not share a common demilitarized Virtual Network (like a microservice grid typically does), you will have to expose an outer-world endpoint. To secure the endpoint you would have to come up with some sort of a token. Token needs to be rotated on a regular basis. Instead of a token-based system, a SSH tunnel can be established, but I doubt Auth0 supports this feature so easily. A rate limiter would be also a strong plus. Anyways, a lot of trouble!

My case is simpler, since I 100% rely on the token payload, I just need to find a way to 1. check if the token is valid, 2. deserialize the token payload, 3. check if a user has permissions for each particular case in the app.

## Terraform

If you don't use protected routes, then you don't need to pull roles client-side. In this case installation of Auth Extension is not required, and you can keep roles and operation on the Auth0 side.
If that is your case, you can make use of [the official Auth0 provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/auth0/index.html) and do everything you need to do.

Otherwise, bad news for you: [Auth Extension can not be terraformed](https://github.com/alexkappa/terraform-provider-auth0/issues/85) (at least not yet) :(

## Hooks

In case if you live in a country where paranoid government forbids keeping user personal data outside of the great iron curtain, we will have to manage profiles on our own...

We need to prevent saving first and last names on the Auth0 side. To do this, we can make use of hooks.

https://auth0.com/docs/hooks/extensibility-points/pre-user-registration

What a pleasant surprise, it is in JavaScript.
