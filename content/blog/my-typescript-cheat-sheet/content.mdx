import { Container } from 'components/Container';

TypeScript became essential part of my professional activity.
It got to the point that if I see pure *JavaScript* code, I simply can't acknowledge that.
I immediately start asking myself "How is that possible for a language to not to have types?".

There are some tips and tricks I don't use quite often, so I decided to write down some notes, so I could always have them available.

## Extend one complex type from another

I am not a huge fan of interfaces and inheritance, since there is plenty of ways to create a derivative type, via "union" and a few extra tricks:

~~~ts
type CarType = {
    speed: number;
    color: string;
    model: string;
};

// Add a subset of properties from CarType
type PlaneTypeA = { 
    class: string
} & Pick<CarType, 'speed' | 'model'>;

// Add one property from CarType
type PlaneType = { 
    class: string;
    speed: CarType["speed"];
};

// "Inherit" type
type SuperCarType = {
    super: boolean;
} & CarType;
~~~

## Typing static class methods

Not a huge sucker for OOP either, but occasionally I have to deal with it. So,

~~~ts
interface CommandProcessorInstance {}

export interface CommandProcessor {
    new (): CommandProcessorInstance;
    attach(program: CommanderCommand): void;
    process(args?: CommandActionArguments): Promise<void>;
}

export function Implements<T>() {
    return <U extends T>(constructor: U) => {
        // eslint-disable-next-line no-unused-expressions
        constructor;
    };
}

@Implements<CommandProcessor>()
export class CommandRun {
    public static attach(
        program: CommanderCommand,
    ) {
        // ...
    }

    public static async process(
        args: CommandActionArguments,
    ) {
        // ...
    }
}
~~~

## Indexed vs Mapped Object vs Record

~~~
type MyMappedObjectType = {
    [k in string | number]: unknown;
};

type MyIndexedType = {
    [k: string]: unknown;
};

type MyRecord = Record<string, unknown>;
~~~

## Assign argument types

If I have multiple functions of the same signature, I don't have to specify argument types every time. Instead, I make a type declaration once
and just assign it to many functions. TS is smart enough to figure argument types in this case.

~~~
type SomeFunctionType = (foo: number, bar: string, baz: boolean) => void;

const funA: SomeFunctionType = (a, b, c) => { ... };
const funB: SomeFunctionType = (a, b, c) => { ... };
const funC: SomeFunctionType = (a, b, c) => { ... };
~~~

## Create types from types

There is a [nice article about that](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/types-from-types.html) ([old version](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/advanced-types.html)).

### Generics

It is possible to use generics to make a dependency between types of function arguments:

~~~
function pluck<T, K extends keyof T>(o: T, propertyNames: K[]): T[K][] {
    return propertyNames.map((n) => o[n]);
}
~~~

### Typeof

Sometimes I can't import types from a third-party library, or I simply don't have types explicitly defined. Nevertheless, there is a way to declare a variable to be of the same type as the other variable:

~~~
const data = [
    { name: 'Alex', position: 'pilot' },
    { name: 'Amos', position: 'tech' },
];

const crewMember: typeof data[0] | undefined;
~~~

### Pulling out the type of an element of an array

Using `typeof` + `infer` + `conditional` is ass-saving when it's too lazy to describe a type, or simply don't have access to library types.

~~~
const data = [
    { name: 'Alex', position: 'pilot', customField: '1' },
    { name: 'Amos', position: 'tech', otherCustomField: true },
];

const ElementType = typeof data extends (infer U)[] ? U : unknown;
~~~
