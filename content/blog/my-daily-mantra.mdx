Aaaaait...., soft subject time. There are some thoughts I am carrying on in my mind for some time already while enjoying my ~~middle-age~~ professional crisis.

Feel free to recognize yourself at least in some of them:

### Coding is my zone of comfort {a}

Nothing for me is as easy as putting my hoody on and going into a tunnel. I can keep making my project without having clear thoughts on when it is really ready. Preferably never, because sharing something I have done with other people is scary. At least, not until it is... perfect! Which goes to the next conclusion:

### There is no such thing as The Perfect Code

The Perfect Code is an illusion that only lives in my mind. Nothing created by humans is perfect. To prevent me from spending an eternity on proving otherwise, there ought to be a pre-defined and healthy balance between quality and some technical debt.

It is really up to me to define where this balance can be found in every particular situation: whether I make dirty-but-working code, or well-written code without obvious flaws, or code that even has some test coverage.

Then, it becomes possible to state "okay, this feature is done, moving forward". This prevents me from slipping while trying to polish whatever I already have.

Dammit, I am even trying to make these 3 paragraphs sound better for, like, 10 minutes already.

To escape this...

### Stop enjoying the process of writing code...

Seriously, it is time for me to say "no" to procrastination. Procrastination means "I will make this thing perfect, but, maybe, tomorrow", which is not something I really want to achieve. What really matters, in the end, is the result I got.

From there we state that...

### ... And begin enjoying to test ideas instead

### The best code is code that was never written

If I have nothing new to say by making the thing, it is better to re-use someone's else work (if the License fits, ofc), otherwise, it will be an Attack of the Clones ‚öîÔ∏è. Reasonable competition is good, having alternatives (that develops the same concept but in a different plane) is good as well, even code kata is sometimes good (if I have free time) (what free time?). Clones are baaaad.

### Learn new tech only when I really need it

Stupid JavaScript. I am already into this for how long... 10 years? Lame! Let's try something new, like C++, or Unity. I like games, Unity seems to be a reasonable career pivot.

Seriously, I should make a difference between raising up my qualification and doing some random crap out of boredom. I should start thinking of it as an investment. How much money it will cost to buy a thing X? How much time will it cost for me to study this piece of tech Y? What will be the profit out of it?

Damn, I am already almost 32, I should really stop wasting time.

My school teacher of Math used to say: "Sergei, always think of what you will achieve by doing this, before even trying to do." To study something relative to my current field would probably make sense, but only if I have some certain project on my mind, where I can immediately apply this new knowledge. But what if I can't even answer "And then what?" question?

### Everything I learn or make I must give back to the world

### Follow agile ways, and especially when you work alone

### Delegate as much as you can

I used to think that in theory, besides coding, I can do practically everything else (maybe except poetry and singing): UI/UX, DevOps, QA, Marketing and... chainsaw juggling. It does not bother me though that it will take a couple of months to study the subject. And in the end, I will be like "The project I was working on? Never heard of".

No jokes - delegate. I am sure that I can make this icon just by poking in the Illustrator, but by what cost? Two weeks? Isn't it wiser to pay some amount of money to somebody who can make the same icon, but faster and more professionally?

One man army sucks, it is ineffective. I can not be proficient in each and every related field. I might have some interest in, say, Kubernetes, and I might even play a little around with the thing, but that should be basically it. I am not a DevOps engineer.

### Be smart, but not too smart

My problem is that sometimes I come up with an overcomplicated idea, and then I spend 3 months on making an MVP and eventually it does not work out. At the same time a guy somewhere out there spends 3 days on building an application's MVP that exposes GoogleAPI and the project already makes some money.

### Scale up your pipelines

### Deliver the first result as soon as possible

### Find a way to battletest your ideas as fast as possible

### Threat your time dedication as an investment

Time is not limitless. Basically you have time until you are 60. When thinking about spending your time on something (not necessary coding), always ask yourself "Then what?". And when the answer to the first question is there, ask yourself "And then what?". This two-steps filter is usually enough to skip total waste of time.
