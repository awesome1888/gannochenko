import { Container } from 'components/Container';

At the early stage of my career I was sort of intert. I worked for one company for 3 years, then for another one - another 4 years. Back then the scope of my responsibilities was pretty much the same:

All JS stack to learn, burned out and broke. The pendulum swung into the opposite way.

Does not make any sense:

1. Companies hire a person who knows 1 (or seldomly 2) ecosystems: to make and app from scratch, support an existing one or migrate from one framework to another.
2. The resources are limited: time of your life is finite (even though you don't realise it when you are 20), you have family, responsibilites, you need to rest.
3. You need to niece down, just like in business.
4. Knowing 100 frameworks does not make you a valuable specialist, theory is thery. More valuable is to have real projects live.

What to do instead

1. Find what really ignites you, make it your speciality and grow there, like construction foam.
2. While declaring one ecosystem to be your main field, briefly check out other ecosystems.
3. Buy other people's skills.
4. Visit meetups regularly, do networking.
