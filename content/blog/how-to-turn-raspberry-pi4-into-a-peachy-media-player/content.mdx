import { Container } from 'components/Container';

### LCD screen setup

Installing Git

~~~bash
sudo apt-get install git -y
~~~

Then, set up the driver itself:

~~~bash
sudo rm -rf LCD-show
git clone https://github.com/goodtft/LCD-show.git
chmod -R 755 LCD-show
cd LCD-show
sudo ./LCD7C-show
~~~

### Gnome setup

Unfortunately, I was not able to complete this process via SSH, I tried two times and both times I got `Broken pipe` on 76%. That is why I had to run it on `Raspberry` itself, using real the keyboard and the monitor I just bought.

~~~bash
sudo tasksel
~~~

### Give more memory to the GPU

~~~bash
sudo raspi-config
~~~

Select 'Gnome' and hit `OK`;
