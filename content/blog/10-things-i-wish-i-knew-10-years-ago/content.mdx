Every time I feel something is off with what I do, I go and re-read this mantra.

## 1. Coding is my zone of comfort {a}

There is no point in coding for coding.

## 2. Start small, but go full-cycle {a}

Тут пример про 3d-моделирование

## 3. Make a small step, get feedback, repeat {a}

"Я не могу показать тебе пока оно не будет готово" - дерьмовая фраза. В реальной жизни это не работает.
Tell people about every tiny thing you make (unless it is not a secret): write an article, make a post in Twitter, shoot a video at Youtube.

## 4. Don't jump between projects {a}

Unless you are stuck or unsure whether it worth it, don't jump between project. Commitment is the key.

## 5. Enjoy testing ideas, not code {a}

Работающие идеи приносят гораздо большее удовлетворение, чем работающий код
Find a way to battle-test your ideas as fast as possible
Stop enjoying the process, the working idea is the result.

## 6. There is no point in perfect code {a}

Рассказать о ситуациях в твоей жизни: битрикс, sl, zj

## 7. The best code is the code never written {a}

It is about re-use. Licensing is basically about whether the other party is willing to share and co-operate and on what terms.

## 8. Make something only when you have something new to say {a}

## 9. Threat your time dedication as an investment {a}

## 10. Delegate {a}

It is not about you being or being not capable of doing something. It is about spending time efficiently by doing what you do best as a professional in your sphere, while delegating all the rest to professionals in other spheres. It is about getting yourself paralleled to save time. Or it is about you struggling with Illustrator and searching for a video on Youtube about how to tackle the next problem you ran into.

Не будь человеком-оркестром. Это не про то, что ты чего-то можешь или не можешь. Это про то, что ты параллелишь себя в более эффективном ключе.

It is not about you being uncapeable of doing something. I am sure you are clever enough to build a spaceship for Musk or create a vaccine against Covid. The only thing you will need in this case is another 10 years to make a PhD in the corresponding sphere and then another 5 to make simpler project of that style.

Don't try to be everybody. You only need to be somebody who knows your field of expertise, be open for brief experiencing other fields and knows how to organise everyone else to make a dream project.

## 11. Automate everything you do, but only when it worth it {a}

## 12. Think, but not too much (or too long) {a}
