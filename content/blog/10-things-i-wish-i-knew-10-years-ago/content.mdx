For quite a long time I was just a developer. But nowadays if a person wants to compete, they have to become something more. So since moving abroad I have started working on my soft skills as well. This path is full of pitfalls and alluring detours for someone who spent 8 years on pure technical stuff.

Therefore, every time I feel something is going off with my professional attitude, I come back here and re-read this list of pivot points I have made. It really helps me moving forward. So, here we go...

## 1. Coding is my zone of comfort {a}

## 2. Present the world everything you do {a}

Sometimes I observe 15 years old kids becoming popular on just another thing they have made. And I keep asking myself a question: "What is it they have and I don't?"

## 2. Start small, but go full-cycle {a}

## 3. Make a small step, get feedback, repeat {a}

## 5. Enjoy testing ideas, not code {a}

## 6. There is no point in perfect code {a}

## 7. The best code is the code never written {a}

## 8. Make something only when you have something new to say {a}

## 9. Threat your time dedication as an investment {a}

## 10. Delegate {a}

## 11. Automate everything you do, but only when it worth it {a}

## 12. Think, but not too much (or too long) {a}

## 13. Do digital detox
