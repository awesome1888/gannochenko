For quite a long time I was just a developer. But nowadays if a person wants to compete, they have to become something more. So since moving abroad I have started working on my soft skills as well. This path is full of pitfalls and alluring detours for someone who spent 8 years on pure technical stuff.

Therefore, every time I feel something is going off with my professional attitude, I come back here and re-read this list of pivot points I have made. It really helps me moving forward. So, here we go...

## 1. Coding is my zone of comfort {a}

## 2. Present the world everything you do {a}

Sometimes I observe 15 years old kids becoming popular on just another thing they have made. And I keep asking myself a question: "What is it they have and I don't?"

## 2. Aim high, but start small {a}

## 2.1 go full-cycle {a}

## 3. Make a small step, get feedback, repeat {a}

## 5. Enjoy testing ideas, not code {a}

## 6. There is no point in perfect code {a}

## 7. The best code is the code never written {a}

## 8. Make something only when you have something new to say {a}

## 9. Threat your time dedication as an investment {a}

## 10. Don't try to be everybody, delegate {a}

I am a software engineer. But before realizing that my aim was to be everybody. I wanted to be capable of making the entire website on my own, from top to bottom. That is why I have bought online courses for Illustrator, After Effects, Photoshop, 3D Max, Sketch.... yet in one month I got stuck!
I asked myself: "Yeh, I can probably be also a talented designer and beat them all, but how many hours will it take to craft that kind of master out of me? 10,000? 100,000?"

Our resources are limited. That is why, even Mother Nature itself says one can not be many. In other case, there would not be mammals, reptiles, birds, fish, insects and so on. It would be just one highly adaptable entity doing everything.
So, what is now then? What you and me can do instead is niche down, and do our field, but also be a manager in the other fields. Then you can buy other people`s time and ask them to work for you.

My time can be better spent if I do what I know how to do, so nowadays if I need to have a graphic asset for my project, I just write a short spec, go to [fl.ru](https://www.fl.ru/) (russian freelance platform) and find somebody who can help me.

That is how I advance without frustration.

## 11. Automate everything you do, but only when it worth it {a}

## 12. Think, but not too much (or too long) {a}

## 13. Do digital detox

## 14. Always look for a an easier way to do the things 

## 15. Don't go frequent multitasking, commit
