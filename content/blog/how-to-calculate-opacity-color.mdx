From time to time I observe designers making derivative colors by applying opacity to a base color against white background. While this approach works perfectly on the design stage, in production an element might not be always located on white. Therefore we need to know exact value to make use of it.

One way to do this is to use a screen color picker like ColorPick Eyedropper. But sometimes it is interesting to know how to make it "by hands". This is how to do that.

Let's take a red color as an example: `#c31528`: <Color color="#c31528" /><br />To make a dirty pale pink color, we can use opacity: `opacity(#c31528, 0.3)`: <Color color="rgb(195, 21, 40, 0.3)" />

If we put this color over something else than white, the color will be different: <Color color="#00ff00" /><Color color="rgb(195, 21, 40, 0.3)" marginLeft="-10px" />

To get the real color we can use the formula:

```
getResultColor(baseColor, opacity) => baseColor * opacity + white * (1 - opacity)
```

`baseColor` is our color: `#C31528`

Let's apply this formula to each byte of the color vector:

```
#C31528 = rgb(195, 21, 40).
195 => getResultColor(195, 0.3) = 195 * 0.3 + 255 * (1 - 0.3) = 237
 21 => getResultColor(21, 0.3) = 21 * 0.3 + 255 * (1 - 0.3) = 184.8
 40 => getResultColor(40, 0.3) = 40 * 0.3 + 255 * (1 - 0.3) = 190.5
result = rgb(237, foor(184.8), floor(190.5)) = #EDB8BE
```

The result color is `#EDB8BE`: <Color color="#EDB8BE" />, looks the same as before: <Color color="rgb(195, 21, 40, 0.3)" />

But against green background now it looks right: <Color color="#00ff00" /><Color color="#EDB8BE" marginLeft="-10px" />

This calculator may help us to find out right value for every base color and opacity:

Hooray, now we know how this works!
