## Accept ownership of the project

## Challenge your own decisions

Not all your ideas a brilliant, somebody may have smarter move, and that is perfectly normal.

## Provide feedback in a right way

Say good things first, then project the critics in a way like you are offering an opinion: "I would do it otherwise", "In my personal opinion ..."

## Aim higher for reasonable level of quality

Since an MVP is done, the quality becomes crucial

## Challenge other respectfully

## Don't create toxic environment

## Be proactive in communications

Stay in touch with key people.

## Be honest

## Advertise your project

Threat your project as a commercial one, all consumers are clients and there is competition

## Take responsibility and don't afraid of mistakes

## Share other team members responsibility

Not my problem that the other developer made a mistake, it's beyond my scope of responsibility. 

## Share your toys with the others

## Reveal the achievements of others

## Value every contribution

Need to salvage as much other people's work as possible, even if it does not go up to the expected level.

## Provide preference-unbiased opinions

Not because "you like", but because there a objective reasons.
