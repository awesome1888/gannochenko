CHANGELOG, CI/CD

how we organized tokens, components, maybe provide a very simple, not business-biased source code of a sample component
also want to include part with the idea pitching, what worked well, what did not work

maybe create two channels:

DS-SYSTEM-NAME-announcements (readonly, public)
DS-SYSTEM-NAME-feedback (public)
