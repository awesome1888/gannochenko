Can't say I use shell scripting a lot, but when I do, I always struggling with remembering certain useful syntax. So, this is just a reminder to myself.

## Save command output to a variable

~~~bash
LIST=$(ls -l)
~~~

## Get the basename of the full path to the script file

~~~bash
DIR="$( cd "$( dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}" )" && pwd )"
~~~

## Assign the default value to a variable

~~~bash
VERSION="${1:-latest}"
~~~

## Execute a command for each file in the folder

~~~bash
FOLDER="$(pwd)"

for file in ${FOLDER}/*
do
  ls -l "$file"
done
~~~

## Get basename of a path

~~~bash
basename /foo/bar/baz/wheel.txt
~~~
