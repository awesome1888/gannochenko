After failing to find a complete and correct guide on how to set up RaspberryPi4 for NodeJS development right, I have decided to make my own instruction.

## Step 0: Prerequisites

-   [RaspberryPI4](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/dp/B07TC2BK1X/),
-   [MicroSD card](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/gp/product/B073K14CVB/) that RaspberryPI will use as a hard drive,
-   [Power source](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/gp/product/B07V3Z9LRT/) (preferably with a case). USB-C charges for Apple Mac might not work out.
-   A password for your WiFi

We are going to setup the device in a headless mode, so there is actually no need to run in circles trying to get a monitor with a keyboard, like the official documentation suggests.

## Step 1: Download the operation system

The OS for RaspberryPI is [Raspbian - a system based on Debian](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/). I have chosen [the light version](https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspbian_lite_latest), since I don't really need the device to run any GUI.

## Step 2: Flash the OS image to the SD Card

We need a flasher to put the Image to the card. [Etcher](https://etcher.io/) worked for me just great: it is free and works like a charm. You can use any other software of your choice.

## Step 3: Enabling SSH and WiFi

By default, SSH is turned off. We need to re-enable it by creating an empty file called `ssh` in the root of the SD Card partition.

```bash
cd /Volumes/boot;
touch ssh;
```

To enable WiFi we create a file called `wpa_supplicant.conf` right next to the previous file with the following content (please replace the `<PLACEHOLDERS>` with actual data):

```editorconfig
ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
update_config=1
country=<TWO_LETTER_ISO_COUNTRY_CODE>

network={
    ssid="<WIFI_NETWORK_NAME>"
    psk="<WIFI_PASSWORD>"
    key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
}
```

## Step 4: Identifying your device's IP address

Plug the SD Card into the device, then connect the device to the power source and turn it on. Give it some time to boot.
We need to identify an IP address that your router gave to the device in your wireless network.

First, let's find out your machine IP address. There are many ways to do that. One way is to use `tracerouting`, while the other is to inspect interfaces with `ifconfig`:

```bash
ifconfig;
```

The output will be something like this:

![ifconfig output](/assets/blog/aux/interfaces.jpg)

In the list of interfaces the one with WiFi is usually easy to find since it will be probably the only one with IPv4 address defined (besides the Loopback interface).
Then we take this IP and use `nmap` tool to scan the WiFi network (don't forget to put your own IP address instead).

```bash
nmap -sn 192.168.178.23/24
```

The output will be something like this:

![nmap output](/assets/blog/aux/cad1168c3c.jpg)

If you don't have `nmap`, you can easily get that installed via `brew` (you do have `brew` on your Mac, don't you?):

```bash
brew install nmap;
```

## Step 5: Connecting to the device via SSH

Connect to the device via SSH (don't forget to replace the IP address with your own).<br />
The default password is "raspberry":

```bash
ssh pi@192.168.178.38
```

If everything worked out and you were able to log in, then we are a go!

## Step 6: Setting up the system

All right, all annoying stuff is already behind, now the cool part comes next!

### Enable SSH access by a key instead of a password

We want to make the thing a little bit more secure, so logging with a password every time is not an option. So.
On your Mac generate an SSH key pair (if you still don't have one):

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096;
```

Then send the public key to RaspberryPI:

```bash
scp ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub pi@192.168.178.38:~;
```

On RaspberryPI create an `.ssh` folder and put the key we just copied into the list of authorized keys:

```bash
cd ~;
mkdir .ssh;
cat ~/id_rsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys;
rm ~/id_rsa.pub;
```

To disable login via password and prevent root log-in open this file for writing:

```bash
sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config;
```

and change the following lines like so:

```text
PermitRootLogin no
PasswordAuthentication no
```

Also prolong SSH session timeout, since you'll need it when running pretty time consuming tasks via SSH:

```text
ClientAliveInterval 3600
```

Then restart the `sshd`:

```bash
sudo service sshd restart;
```

Boom! You are now able to log-in without a password.

### Installing NodeJS

Make a system-scale upgrade first:

```bash
sudo apt-get update;
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade;
```

Then install NodeJS using NVM:

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.35.3/install.sh | bash;
source ~/.bashrc;
nvm install 13;
nvm use 13;
nvm alias default 13;
node -v;
```

### Installing Yarn

My favourite package manager is still `yarn`, so:

```bash
curl -sS https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/pubkey.gpg | sudo apt-key add -;
echo "deb https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/ stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/yarn.list;
sudo apt update;
sudo apt install --no-install-recommends yarn;
yarn -v;
```

### Bonus: installing Docker

You may want to dockerise the applications you run on your PI. So, we need Docker.
Since PI's processor is ARM, the official ways of installing Docker will not work. Let's do it otherwise.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh;
sudo sh get-docker.sh;
rm get-docker.sh;
sudo usermod -aG docker `whoami`;
docker version;
```

### Bonus 2: installing Docker-compose

For local development there is no life without Docker-compose, so let's install that one as well.

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y libffi-dev libssl-dev python3 python3-pip;
sudo apt-get remove python-configparser;
sudo pip3 install docker-compose;
docker-compose -v;
```

Well, hope that everything worked great for you, and... happy gadget building!
