import { Container } from 'components/Container';
import { TwitterLink } from 'components/TwitterLink';

Front-end engineers create dozens of components every week. Building just another web application is one thing, but when it comes to reusable components within a unified and sustainable design system, the situation changes drastically.

While working on a design system, I have experimented a lot, and came up with a quite promising component boilerplate for such occasion. Here it is.

## TL;DR

[Codesandbox here](https://codesandbox.io/s/green-snowflake-nih5j?file=/src/App.js).

...or

Generate common code (utils and types that can be re-used in all components):

~~~bash
npx @generilla/cli run https://github.com/gannochenko/react-component-boilerplate/tree/master/commons
~~~

Generate the component itself:

~~~bash
cd components && npx @generilla/cli run https://github.com/gannochenko/react-component-boilerplate/tree/master/component
~~~

## Prerequisites

ðŸ‘‰ CSS-in-JS with [Styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) or [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/) for styling. It turns boring CSS into a fully-featured programming language based on JavaScript, so cool.<br />
ðŸ‘‰ React that supports hooks.<br />
ðŸ‘‰ TypeScript.

## First step

I took a boring sign-in as a today's challenge:

![Signup form](./wireframe.png)

The starter code is a function component, according to the latest trends.
I also refrain from using default exports, since named exports make in-IDE refactoring easier in the future:

~~~typescript jsx
import React, { FC } from 'react';

export const SignInForm: FC = () => {
    return null;
};
~~~

## File structure

Many developers prefer keeping styles and type declarations next to the component itself.
I usually don't do that, because the more complex the component gets, the more code I will have to co-locate in one file.
Several-screens-tall file is difficult to maintain and comprehend.

That is why in my projects I propose the following file structure:

~~~text
SignInForm/
    index.ts
    SignInForm.tsx <-- the component itself goes here
    styles.ts
    types.ts
~~~

Why `index.ts` file?

First of all, this kind of import will work:<br />`import { SignInForm } from './components/SignInForm'`

Secondly, via `index.ts` file I can explicitly tell which part of the component I wish to expose to the end user:

~~~typescript
export { SignInForm } from './SignInForm';
export type { SignInFormPropType } from './types';
// maybe something else ...
~~~

## The scope of responsibility

Every component has a `scope of responsibility`. It other words, a component is only responsible for what is inside of it, and completely unaware of its siblings or a parent node.

~~~typescript jsx
...

import React, { forwardRef, FC } from 'react';

export const SignInForm: FC = forwardRef(
    function SignInForm(props, ref) {
        // every component should have a root node
        // also,I am forwarding ref to the root node
        return (
            <SignInFormRoot ref={ref}>
                <SignInInput />
                <SignInInput type="password" />
                <SignInFormSubmitButton>
                    Sign-in
                </SignInFormSubmitButton>
            </SignInFormRoot>
        );
    }
);

...
~~~

## Component props

As you may have already noticed, I used `type`, not `interface` when declaring the typings. While interfaces have their advantages in some way,
I prefer going with types. This way the paradigm Â«prefer composition over inheritanceÂ» becomes easily feasible through `union`, unlike the OOP-ish inheritance via `extends` keyword. 

I also

ðŸ‘‰ use `Type` postfix for types to explicitly indicate the fact that this is not a variable,<br />
ðŸ‘‰ have all props optional, because the component should gracefully handle situations when it was called without parameters.<br />

It is also nice to have property naming agreements, for example like these ones:

ðŸ‘‰ names of all callback props should begin with `on` prefix (e.g. `onSubmitButtonClick`),<br />
ðŸ‘‰ if a property is used as a feature flag, its name should begin with `enable` prefix (like `enablePasswordLess`),<br />
ðŸ‘‰ names of all render props should start with `render` prefix (e.g. `renderActionBar`)<br />

...and so on.

It may seem too much in the beginning, but when you build a long-lasting design system and wish to remain consistent, not following the rules quickly starts causing problems.

So, the props could be:

~~~typescript jsx
import { HTMLAttributes } from 'react';

type ObjectLiteralType<V = any> = { [k: string]: V };

type ThemeType = {}; // replace this with your own theme type

type StylePropType = {
    theme: ThemeType;
};

export type SignInFormPropType =
    // first, take all native props for a desired type of DOM node
    HTMLAttributes<HTMLFormElement> &
    // declare all custom props here
    Partial<{
      loading: boolean;
      onSubmit: (result: { login: string; password: string }) => void;
      enablePasswordLess: boolean;
    }> &
    // allow any other custom props, like data- props to pass as well
    ObjectLiteralType;

export type SignInFormRootPropType = StylePropType & SignInFormPropType;

export type SignInFormInputPropType = StylePropType & ObjectLiteralType;

export type SignInFormSubmitButtonPropType = StylePropType & ObjectLiteralType;
~~~

## Styling

Normally I develop components in greenhouse conditions somewhere in Storybook.
But the thing is, real projects (especially legacy ones) provide a much more &laquo;hostile&raquo; environment,
since there may be global CSS defined that could potentially distort appearance of the component drastically.

That is why I created a helper function to reset at least box-sizing and margin as well as maybe
some of the [inherited CSS properties](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5612302/which-css-properties-are-inherited).

~~~typescript
import styled, { css } from 'styled-components';
import { SignInFormRootPropType, SignInFormInputPropType, SignInFormSubmitButtonPropType } from './types';

export const getResetStyle = () => css`
    box-sizing: border-box;
    margin: 0;
`;

export const SignInFormRoot = styled.form<SignInFormRootPropType>`
    ${getResetStyle};
    padding: 1rem;
`;

export const SignInInput = styled.input<SignInFormInputPropType>`
    ${getResetStyle};
    border: 1px solid gray;
    border-radius: 2px;
    // ...
`;

export const SignInFormSubmitButton = styled.button<SignInFormSubmitButtonPropType>`
    ${getResetStyle};
    border-radius: 2px;
    background-color: blue;
    color: white;
    // ...
`;
~~~

## Conditional styles

Usually when it comes to conditional styling with `styled-components`, things turn into unreadable porridge of figure and square brackets very quickly. Nevertheless, I have tried to minimize the negative impact by moving everything to a separate helper:

~~~typescript
...

const getRootStyle = ({ loading, disabled }: SignInFormRootPropType) => {
    let result = {};
    
    if (loading) {
        result = css`
            ${result};
            color: grey;
            // some other css
        `;
    }
    
    if (disabled) {
        result = css`
            ${result};
            display: none;
            // some other css
        `;
    }
    
    // maybe some other props
    
    return result;
};

export const SignInFormRoot = styled.form<SignInFormRootPropType>`
    ${getResetStyle};
    padding: 1rem;
    ${getRootStyle};
`;

...
~~~

When a custom property goes through a cabbage of wrappers and lands on the DOM node, React starts polluting the console with a bunch of annoying warnings like &laquo;Warning: React does not recognize the `loading` prop on a DOM element. Blah, blah...&raquo;
To prevent this, `styled-components` starting from v5 has a helper called `shouldForwardProp`.

~~~typescript
// ...

// all unwanted custom props should be blacklisted
const customProps = {
    loading: true,
    disabled: true,
};

export const SignInFormRoot = styled.div.withConfig({
    shouldForwardProp: prop => !(prop in customProps),
})<SignInFormRootPropType>`
    ${getResetStyle};
    padding: 1rem;
    ${getRootStyle};
`;

// ...
~~~

## View and controller separation

Now comes the cool part!

Back in early days the controller and the view (UI) of a component were sort of fused together within a *class component*.
Some tried to abuse inheritance, others came up with that &laquo;concept of smart and dumb components&raquo;. None of it really worked out well.
With react hooks it became really easy to decouple the code.

I am gonna put all the logic into a hook `useSignInForm` located in a separate file.
UI stays pretty clean and easily perceivable by just quick glancing at.

The result of the hook is a structure that contains props forwarded to the UI elements.

~~~typescript
import { Ref, useCallback } from 'react';
import { SignInFormPropType } from './types';

export const useSignInForm = (
    ref: Ref<unknown>,
    {
        loading,
        onSubmit,
        enablePasswordLess,
        ...props
    }: SignInFormPropType
) => {
    // put all your logic here: call some useMemo, useEffect or useCallback, or any other custom hook
    // ...

    // for example,
    const onSubmitClick = useCallback(() => {
        onSubmit({ login, password }); // take from local state updated by callbacks for inputs
    }, [onSubmit, login, password]);

    return {
        rootProps: {
            ...props, // rest props go to the root node, as before
            ref, // same for the ref
        },
        loginInputProps: {
            disabled: loading,
            onChange: onLoginInputChange, // defined somewhere above
        },
        passwordInputProps: {
            type: 'password',
            disabled: loading,
            onChange: onPasswordInputChange, // defined somewhere above
        },
        submitButtonProps: {
            onClick: onSubmitClick,
            disabled: loading,
        },
        showPasswordInput: !enablePasswordLess,
    };
};
~~~

Then I consume the hook in `SignInForm.tsx`:

~~~typescript jsx
...

import { useSignInForm } from './hooks/useSignInForm.ts';

export const SignInForm: FC<SignInFormPropType> = forwardRef(
    function SignInForm(props, ref) {

        const {
            rootProps,
            loginInputProps,
            passwordInputProps,
            submitButtonProps,
            showPasswordInput
        } = useSignInForm(ref, props);

        return (
            <SignInFormRoot {...rootProps}>
                <SignInInput {...loginInputProps} />
                {
                    showPasswordInput
                    &&
                    <SignInInput {...passwordInputProps} />
                }
                <SignInFormSubmitButton {...submitButtonProps}>
                    Sign-in
                </SignInFormSubmitButton>
            </SignInFormRoot>
        );
    }
);
~~~

## Class names

There should be a way to customise not only the root node, but also all inner nodes.
One of the options could be to define class names to address the nodes via `styled`.

The format of a class name could be different, I personally prefer `BEM` (e.g. `SignInForm-Input--disabled`).

So first of all, I define a custom hook:

~~~typescript
import { useMemo } from 'react';

const makeClassName = (blockName: string, elementName = 'Root', modifier?: string) => 
    `${blockName}-${elementName}${modifier ? `--${modifier}` : ''}`;

export const useSignInFormClassNames = (
    componentName: string,
    className: string,
) => useMemo(() => ({
    Root: `${className} ${makeClassName(componentName)}`,
    LoginInput: makeClassName(componentName, 'LoginInput'),
    PasswordInput: makeClassName(componentName, 'PasswordInput'),
    SubmitButton: makeClassName(componentName, 'SubmitButton'),
}), [ componentName, className ]);
~~~

Then I consume the hook right next to the first one:

~~~typescript jsx
import { useSignInFormClassNames } from './hooks/useSignInFormClassNames';

export const SignInForm: FC<SignInFormPropType> = forwardRef(
    function SignInForm({ className, ...props}, ref) {

        const {
            rootProps,
            loginInputProps,
            passwordInputProps,
            submitButtonProps,
            showPasswordInput
        } = useSignInForm(ref, props);

        const classNames = useSignInFormClassNames('SignInForm', className);

        return (
            <SignInFormRoot 
                {...rootProps}
                className={classNames.Root}
            >
                <SignInInput
                    {...loginInputProps}
                    className={classNames.LoginInput}
                />
                {
                    showPasswordInput
                    &&
                    <SignInInput
                        {...passwordInputProps}
                        className={classNames.PasswordInput}
                    />
                }
                <SignInFormSubmitButton
                    {...submitButtonProps}
                    className={classNames.SubmitButton}
                >
                    Sign-in
                </SignInFormSubmitButton>
            </SignInFormRoot>
        );
    }
);
~~~

If this is done, the customization works like this:

~~~typescript
const CustomSignInForm = styled(SignInForm)`
    color: red;
    .SignInForm-Input {
        border-radius: 4px;
    }
    .SignInForm-SubmitButton {
        color: white;
    }
`;
~~~

## Atomic props

In general I would not go with this too far. Atomic props introduce additional computation, sometimes unnecessary.
Nevertheless, sometimes it make sense to have at least `margin`, `padding`, `width`, `height` defined as atomic.

Margin props could look somewhat like this:

~~~typescript
import { css } from 'styled-components';

export type ScalarType = string | number;

export type MarginPropType = Partial<{
    margin: ScalarType;
    marginTop: ScalarType;
    marginBottom: ScalarType;
    marginLeft: ScalarType;
    marginRight: ScalarType;
}>;

const getValue = (value?: ScalarType) => {
    if (typeof value === 'string') {
        return value;
    }

    // in case of number, can do something fun here,
    // like converting spacing unit to pixels, or pixels to rem
    return value;
};

const getStyleFor = (property: string, value?: ScalarType) => 
    value !== undefined ? `${property}: ${getValue(value)};` : '';

export const getMarginStyle = ({
    margin,
    marginTop,
    marginBottom,
    marginLeft,
    marginRight,
}: MarginPropType) => css`
    ${getStyleFor('margin', margin)}
    ${getStyleFor('margin-top', marginTop)}
    ${getStyleFor('margin-bottom', marginBottom)}
    ${getStyleFor('margin-left', marginLeft)}
    ${getStyleFor('margin-right', marginRight)}
`;
~~~

Then plug the mixin into the component.

To styles:

~~~typescript
import { getMarginStyle } from '../../utils/getMarginStyle';

const SignInFormRoot = styled.div.withConfig({
    shouldForwardProp: prop => !(prop in customProps),
})<SignInFormRootPropType>`
    ${getResetStyle};
    padding: 1rem;
    ${getRootStyle};
    ${getMarginStyle}; // <-- injected here
`;
~~~

To types:

~~~typescript
import { MarginPropType } from '../style/getMarginStyle';

type SignInFormPropType =
    HTMLFormElement & 
    Partial<{
        loading: boolean;
        onSubmit: ({ login: string; password: string; }) => void;
        enablePasswordLess: boolean;
    }> &
    MarginPropType & // <-- injected here
    ObjectLiteralType;
~~~

When this is done, the atomic props become available:

~~~typescript jsx
<SignInForm marginTop="10px" marginLeft="2rem" />
~~~

## Prop types

Sometimes when building a reusable component written in `TypeScript`, it is easy to forget, that a component can be used in a project written in plain `JavaScript`.
`PropTypes` can be a big deal of help in this case, acting as a drop-in replacement for TS types. Also, `PropTypes` do *runtime* prop validation, whereas TS types only do *static code analysis* (which is sufficient in most of the cases though).

## Default props

Default props is a nice addition when you want to have some props set to something else than *undefined*.

~~~typescript
...

SignInForm.defaultProps = {
  onSubmit: () => {}
};
~~~

***

That is pretty much it for this boilerplate! Certainly, not all of the features are needed when it comes to making actual components IRL.
But, it is still nice to have all of these features in one place. Every time we build a component or a set of components which should be
consistent, we can easily take this code as a starter!
