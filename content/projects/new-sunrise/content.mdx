# New Sunrise: a mod for CnC3:KW

<ProjectReleaseDate date={props.pageContext.frontmatter.date} released={false} />

Woah, that was a lifetime ago.

So back in the university days I was a fan of the Command&Conquer game franchise. When C&C3 by Electronic Arts finally came out, a colossal wave of disappointment swept through the society of fans.
The game was nothing like expected to be, but the good part was that it's engine &mdash; Sage was able to make use of &laquo;external&raquo; resources and the resources were open for modification.

Many people (including myself) dared to try creating a better version of C&C3, worth of perished Westwood studio.

This project have not taken off though. I was daydreaming too much, doing too little, I was not disciplined. Eventually the initiative was killed by procrastination and urge of writing my Master's thesis.

But, the reason why I am mentioning it here, is that it was my first experience of team building.

Looking back I must admit, that I would have done many things in a different way. I would have,

* written down overall concept of the modification &mdash; what was planned and what was not,
* turned this concept into a public statement, and started forming a community around it,
* developed a strong business process of creating each new unit,
* defined time frames, estimated the amount of time needed to create one unit,
* came up with a plan and a road map,
* constantly shared the progress on a simple website,
* created a wizard-like generator to make bootstrapping easier,
* looked for people to fill the existing gaps of expertise (e.g. in animation and rigging), instead of trying to study all of it on my own,
* looked for people to give me a hand and do some work in parallel.

Also may be good to bring some new ideas on the table, instead of trying to replicate what Westwood had in mind.

Yeh, I wish I was more experienced back then. Anyway, here is the link to the mod on Moddb:
