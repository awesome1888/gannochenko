# Altstadtkirche of Königsberg

<ProjectReleaseDate date={props.pageContext.frontmatter.date} released={false} />

I am actually a fan of the East European X-XIX traditional architecture. After I moved to Kaliningrad, I literary fell in love with the medieval and modern historical period of the city.
Before the WWII the city belonged to germans, and was called Königsberg.
Today it is a post-soviet, rather gray place, where all the beautiful pre-war architecture was almost entirely lost due to the bombing by British air force and the follow-up ideological Russians barbarity.

Nevertheless, we still have the historical pictures ❤️

I found some pictures of a gorgeous XIX church which used to be in the center of the historical part of the town, and decided to make a 3D-model.
