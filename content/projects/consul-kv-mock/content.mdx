# HashiCorp Consul Key-Value store mock

<ProjectReleaseDate date={props.pageContext.frontmatter.date} />

While working for one of my employers I faced a problem of missing Consul ersatz parts for development purpose. The infrastructure team was using the Key-Value store, and there was no way to mock it locally.

So one Friday evening <s>after a beer or two</s> I have decided to make a tiny Docker image that settled this.

## Implementation
