# Ren39 - the list of old building of Kaliningrad assigned to be torn down

<ProjectReleaseDate date={props.pageContext.frontmatter.date} released={props.pageContext.frontmatter.released} />

Since I have become a fan of history of Kaliningrad, at some point I have decided to make a difference and start doing some urban activism.

The [Ren39 project](https://ren39.ru/) tells about the valuable historical buildings soon to be demolished and torn down. Yes, it is in Russian :) And it has the same design as this blog, this is because I used the same template :) But who cares?:)

Almost every building you can see at the website will soon turn into an empty place. At least we have photos.
