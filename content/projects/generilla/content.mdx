import { ProjectReleaseDate } from 'components/ProjectDetailsPageLayout/components/ProjectReleaseDate';

# Generilla &mdash; a CLI tool for JS code generation

<ProjectReleaseDate date={props.pageContext.frontmatter.date} />

## Problem

ðŸ‘‰ Automate frequently repeated and annoying activity of file and folder structure creation.<br />
ðŸ‘‰ The functionality of live templates in my IDE is already not enough for this.<br />
ðŸ‘‰ Enable keeping the best practices and knowledge beyond the scope of a certain project.<br />
ðŸ‘‰ Eliminate the &laquo;Don't remember how I did it before&raquo; problem.<br />

## Solution

Create a code generator which

ðŸ‘‰ has the same powerful features that existing tools have,<br />
ðŸ‘‰ is more JS/TS stack oriented,<br />
ðŸ‘‰ provide some features existing solutions don't have.<br />

## Implementation
