### 2011

I was a 23-year old student with tremendous amount of free time and zero responsibilities in my life. Unfortunately, back then I had absolutely no idea that in order for the project to succeed, you need to introduce proper planing and milestones. It is totally crucial to delegate, prioritize, manage efforts, constantly re-use as much of assets as possible, provide intermediate versions and demos to tease up users.

Well... due to my lack of management skills back then, the project was eventually ruined by procrastination. Many years have passed since that time, I have settled my private life (LOL) and chose something different rather than gamedev, so there is no chance I am going back on this project, even though EA seem to have intentions to breath-in new life into the CNC universe. Still, it was nice experience on how you should lead your project if the goal is complete failure.
