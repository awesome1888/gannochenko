So, I would say I am **70% frontend** software engineer. That is why the following stack I use every day during my work process:
[/BLOCK][block widget=skills type=frontend]1[/BLOCK][block contentalign=center]
When it comes to the backend part, my best choice is
[/BLOCK][block widget=skills type=backend]1[/BLOCK][block widget=block contentalign=center]
For a full-stack engineer it is crucial to understand DevOps and how the system typically gets deployed, so occasionally I use these:
[/BLOCK][block widget=skills type=devops]1[/BLOCK][block widget=block contentalign=center]
As for the code management, I personally prefer GIT, but HG also works perfectly :)
[/BLOCK][block widget=skills type=util]1[/BLOCK][block]
There are also several things I am familiar with and probably can make something relatively basic out of it... after spending a day or two googling the subject :)

This section is there for the "familiarity with blah is a plus" reasons :)
[/BLOCK][block widget=skills type=familiar]1[/BLOCK][block]
And finally, I got few technologies that I, generally speaking, don't work with anymore, even though from time to time I may look into it.

I hope that you find my tech radar diverse and pretty aligned with yours. If there is a match, [drop me a message](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gannochenko/)!
