So, I would say I am **70% frontend** software engineer. That is why the following stack I use every day during my work process:

<Skills type="frontend" />

</Container>

<br />
<Effect name="fade-slide-bottom" durationA={300} easeA="preset:bounce" parameterA="20">
<Container>

When it comes to the backend part, my best choice is

<Skills type="backend" />

</Container>
</Effect>

<br />
<Effect name="fade-slide-bottom" durationA={300} easeA="preset:bounce" parameterA="20">
<Container>

For a full-stack engineer it is crucial to understand DevOps and how the system typically gets deployed, so occasionally I use these:

<Skills type="devops" />

</Container>
</Effect>

<br />
<Effect name="fade-slide-bottom" durationA={300} easeA="preset:bounce" parameterA="20">
<Container>

As for the code management, I personally prefer GIT, but HG also works perfectly :)

<Skills type="util" />

</Container>
</Effect>

<br />
<Effect name="fade-slide-bottom" durationA={300} easeA="preset:bounce" parameterA="20">
<Container>

There are also several things I am familiar with and probably can make something relatively basic out of it... after spending a day or two googling the subject :)
This section is there for the "familiarity with blah is a plus" reasons :)

<Skills type="familiar" />

</Container>
</Effect>

<br />
<Effect name="fade-slide-bottom" durationA={300} easeA="preset:bounce" parameterA="20">
<Container>

And finally, I got few technologies that I, generally speaking, don't work with anymore, even though from time to time I may look into it.

<Skills type="dated" />

I hope that you find my tech radar diverse and pretty aligned with yours. If there is a match, [drop me a message](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gannochenko/)!
